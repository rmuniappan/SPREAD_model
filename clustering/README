The files with prefix "master_" are the wrapper scripts that call other
scripts in a certain order. For most python scripts, "<script> -h" provides
a brief description of what the code does, its input and output. The setup
assumes that there is a "work" folder inside the "code" folder where all
the scripts are called from.

master_cluster.sh: Preprocessing simulation output, clustering it and post
processing the outcomes.

master_analysis.sh: CART and Random Forest analysis of the clustered data.

cart_cluster.R: CART analysis of clustered data.

random_forest_cluster.R: Random Forest analysis of clustered data.

cluster_instances.py: Clusters simulation output using pyclustering.

post_process_simfile.py: Simulation files are processed and concatenated
into a single csv file given as input to cluster_instances.py
